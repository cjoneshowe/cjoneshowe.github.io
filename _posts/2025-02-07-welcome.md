Exploring Cybersecurity, Ethical AI, and Digital Literacy
======

Hello and welcome to my blog!
------

This space is dedicated to exploring the intersections of cybersecurity in education, ethical AI, and digital literacy—three areas that are shaping the future of how we learn, work, and engage with technology. As a PhD student in Informatics at the University at Albany, I am passionate about researching and discussing the challenges and opportunities within these fields.

What You Can Expect:

Through this blog, I’ll be sharing:
-Insights from my research – breaking down complex topics in cybersecurity, AI ethics, and digital literacy into accessible discussions.
-Practical applications – exploring how these topics impact educators, students, businesses, and everyday users.
-Industry trends and news – analyzing recent developments and their implications.
-Project updates – offering a behind-the-scenes look at my academic and professional work.

Why This Matters:

Technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, and with it comes the need for critical conversations about security, privacy, and ethical responsibility. Whether you’re an educator, student, tech professional, or simply someone interested in digital culture, this blog aims to provide valuable insights that help navigate today’s digital landscape.

I look forward to engaging with you and building a community around these important discussions. Feel free to comment, ask questions, or suggest topics you’d like to see covered!
